## Overview
Home Fly is a search engine that returns the list of nearest homeless shelters in Chicago. It features Twilio integration to accept a text of an address to our server and automatically return the nearest shelter's information.

Home Fly was the **first-place** submission to Northern Illinois's Hackathon September 26th, 2015.

----
## Motivation
Our idea was inspired from the challenges those who are homeless and their struggles to find a vacant shelter.

---
## How we built it
We built it with the Meteor framework which allows us to utilize MongoDB for data storage. The rest was written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
